Thank you for contributing to the development of fire! Your support (no matter how big or small) is greatly appreciated.

Following these guidelines helps us communicate more effectively and helps make sure fire continues to increase in quality.

fire is open to any and all contributions. This includes (but is not limited to)
- Improvement of documentation (do you have a set of notes that isn't covered by the documentation? Let's include them!)
- Writing tutorials (did you figure something out that was hard to do?)
- Bug identification (did you find odd or broken behavior?)
- Bug patching (have you solved odd or broken behavior?)
- New feature implementation (have you implented an improvement that can be shared?)

One caveat to the acceptance of all contributions is major refactoring or redesigning that may change the goals outlined in the Design Goals document.
If you are thinking of making a large change, be sure your updates align with those goals.

### Ground Rules

### Getting Started
For anything bigger than a one or two line fix, please open an issue to alert all other developers that you are working on it. 
This also gives you a good opportunity to check if another issue is the same or similar. 
If your work is not related to a bug, open a "Feature Request" template issue.
When starting to develop,

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Develop on your fork of the code
3. If you like your changes and they pass the tests included, open a Pull Request from your fork into the `trunk` branch.

### Bug Reporting
If you have discovered a bug within fire, please open an issue on GitHub to alert the developers.
You can select the "Bug Report" template issue to work off of.
