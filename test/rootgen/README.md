# ROOT-based Framework File Generation
This directory and its contents are meant to mimic the usage of the [ROOT-based Framework](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/Framework) in a very light [module](Module). 
This module is meant to mimic the event object in the other test module so that the ROOT files generated by this code can be used to test ROOT file reading with fire.
